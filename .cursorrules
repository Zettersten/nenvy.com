## Project: Nenvy static site (award-style)

### Goals
- **Modern, award-forward design**: bold typography, kinetic motion, premium polish.
- **Responsive-first UX**: works beautifully from small phones to ultrawide desktops.
- **Animation engineering**: motion should be intentional, performant, and readable.
- **Accessible by default**: keyboard nav, focus states, reduced-motion support.
- **Maintainable**: small modules, clear ownership of styles, minimal global leakage.

### Structure
- `index.html`: single-page layout + content. Keep it semantic and accessible.
- `css/`
  - `main.css`: CSS entrypoint (imports in order)
  - `tokens.css`: theme variables + type scale
  - `base.css`: reset + base document styles
  - `layout.css`: nav + layout skeleton
  - `components.css`: reusable components (buttons, section head, icons)
  - `sections.css`: section-specific styling (hero, marquee, process, etc.)
  - `motion.css`: motion states (e.g. reveal defaults)
  - `responsive.css`: breakpoints + coarse pointer + reduced motion rules
- `js/`
  - `main.js`: entrypoint (initializes features)
  - `utils/`: tiny helpers (env detection, DOM helpers)
  - `features/`: interactive features (nav, cursor glow, copy, magnetic, three hero)
  - `motion/`: GSAP/ScrollTrigger orchestration and text splitting utilities

### Runtime dependencies (global CDN)
- **GSAP** and **ScrollTrigger** are loaded in `index.html` and accessed as `window.gsap` / `window.ScrollTrigger`.
- **Three.js** is loaded in `index.html` and accessed as `window.THREE`.
- These are intentionally *not bundled* to keep the repo simple and static-host-friendly.

### Motion rules
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`:
  - No marquee
  - No cursor glow
  - No heavy scroll-scrub animations
- Avoid scroll-jank:
  - Disable expensive parallax on `(pointer: coarse)`
  - Use `ScrollTrigger` scrubbing (GSAP) instead of manual scroll handlers

### Coding conventions
- ES modules only (no global app state objects).
- Feature modules export `initX()` functions, called from `js/main.js`.
- Keep selectors stable. Prefer data attributes (e.g. `[data-reveal]`) for motion hooks.
- When adding a new section:
  - Add markup in `index.html`
  - Add section styling in `css/sections.css` (or create a new section file if it grows)
  - Add motion in `js/motion/gsap-motion.js` behind reduced-motion checks

### Quality bar
- No long-running loops or scroll handlers outside GSAP/ScrollTrigger.
- Keep line lengths readable and styles grouped by responsibility.
- Any “wow” effect must remain legible and performant.
